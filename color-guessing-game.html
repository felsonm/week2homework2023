        var COLORS_ARRAY = ['blue', 'cyan', 'gold', 'gray', 'green', 'magenta', 'orange', 'red', 'white', 'yellow'];

       
// ** Part 3: Set up variables for the runGame function and determine the correct guess Declare two variables using the let keyword: one named guess and one named correct. Initialize guess to the value of an empty string. Initialize correct to the Boolean value of false.
// Declare a const variable named targetIndex. For its value, use what you have learned about arrays and generating random numbers using Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate a random number that is between 0 and the last index number of the COLORS_ARRAY array. 
//The max number should be calculated dynamically rather than hard coded. Recall what you have learned about checking the length of the array, and that due to zero-indexing, the index of the last number of the array is always one less than its length. 
//For example: If your array has 10 colors in it, your program should automatically generate a number between 0 and 9. If you were to add 1 more color to the array, your program should automatically generate a number between 0 and 10. 
//Declare a const named target and assign to it the value of the COLORS_ARRAY item that has the array index of targetIndex. So for example, if the random number stored in targetIndex is 3, the color name in COLORS_ARRAY with the index of 3 should now be stored in target. (In the example array given above, that value would be 'gray'.)
//TIP: This is not necessary for the game logic, but to make it easier for you as a developer to test the game, we suggest that you add a console.log at this point to log the target to the console. 
       
        function runGame() {
            let guess = 'I am thinking of one of these colors:\n\n' + COLORS_ARRAY +
                '\n\nWhat color am I thinking of?\n';
            let correct = false;
            const targetIndex = Math.floor(Math.random(COLORS_ARRAY) * 9) + 1;
            const target = targetIndex;
//Part 4: Prompt for a guess until correct guess is made
//Write a do ... while loop. The condition to exit the loop should be: !correct (this is the same as saying (correct === false))
//Inside the loop block, assign the value of the guess variable to the return value of calling prompt(), using the following string as the text for the prompt:
//'I am thinking of one of these colors:\n\n' + COLORS_ARRAY + '\n\nWhat color am I thinking of?\n'
//The \n characters will cause a newline in the text. 
//Below this and still inside the loop block, set up an if statement. The if condition should check if guess === null. If the player hits "Cancel" on the prompt, this is the value that will be assigned to guess. If so, display an appropriate message to the user and use a return statement with no return value. This will exit the entire runGame function and end the game.
//Below this, still inside the loop block, assign the value of the variable correct to the return value from calling the function checkGuess. Pass two arguments to the checkGuess function: guess and target. 
//After the program has exited the loop - below it, but still inside the runGame function, set up an alert that gives the user a congratulations message.
        
            do
                prompt(guess)
            while (correct === false);
            if (guess === null){
                return;
            }


        }

        function checkGuess(guess, target) {
